# Slew Rate of telescopic amplifier

## Slew Rate

Slew rate is **the maximum rate of change that you can get on the output**.

If you apply **a large enough voltage STEP at the input, large enough that it saturates the diff pair, i.e. all the current goes to one branch while the other is dry**, then the current Io will flow to the output, charging the output cap C up at a constant current, so **the voltage will rise with a slope of that current divided by C**.

ThatÂ´s the Slew Rate.

To measure the slew rate we add the capacitive load at the output, thus completing the op amp, and we apply unity gain feedback.
